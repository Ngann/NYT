          <h1>Aspect ratio grid</h1>
          <p>I noticed that using the CSS aspect ratio hack was causing issues with CSS Grid (when I needed all grid cells to be a 1:1 aspect ratio but some grid children to span more than one cell) so this is a solution with CSS Variables and a sprinkling of calc() instead. It does rely on knowing the outer width of the wrapper though (doesn’t work as a percentage value).</p>
          <p>If you change the wrapper and / or gutter variables you’ll see the blocks still maintain theor aspect ratio <em>except</em> where the content in longer than the block, then they grow to fit.</p>
